# Portfolio

This project aims to showcase a personal portfolio website. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses Node.js for package management.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Folder Structure

The project source code typically resides in the following directories:

- `pages/` – application routes and pages
- `components/` – reusable UI components
- `public/` – static assets such as images and fonts
- `styles/` – global and component-level styling

Additional build outputs are ignored by Git as configured in `.gitignore`.

## Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This will output compiled files to the `.next/` directory and serve the production build.

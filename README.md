# Portfolio

This project showcases a personal portfolio website with a clean, professional design. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses Node.js for package management.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Folder Structure

The project source code typically resides in the following directories:

- `app/` – routes built with the Next.js App Router
- `src/components/` – reusable UI components
- `public/` – static assets such as images and fonts
- `src/lib/` – data used across pages

Additional build outputs are ignored by Git as configured in `.gitignore`.

## Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This will output compiled files to the `.next/` directory and serve the production build.
